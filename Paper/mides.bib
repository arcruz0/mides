abstract = {This paper discusses identification based on difference-in-differences (DiD) approaches with multiple treatments. It shows that an appropriate adaptation of the common trend assumption underlying the DiD strategy for the comparison of two treatments restricts the possibility of effect heterogeneity for at least one of the treatments. The required assump-tion of effect homogeneity is likely to be violated because of non-random assignment to treatment based on both observables and unobservables. However, this paper shows that, under certain conditions, the DiD estimate comparing two treatments identifies a lower bound in absolute values on the average treatment effect on the treated compared to the unobserved non-treatment state, even if effect homogeneity is violated. This is possible if the treatments have ordered treatment effects, that is, in expectation, the effects of both treatments compared to no treatment have the same sign, and one treatment has a stronger effect than the other treatment on the respective recipients. Such assumptions are plausible if treatments are ordered or vary in intensity.},

@article{Kleinberg2015,
abstract = {Empirical policy research often focuses on causal inference. Since policy choices seem to depend on understanding the counterfactual— what happens with and without a policy—this tight link of causality and policy seems natural. While this link holds in many cases, we argue that there are also many policy applications where causal inference is not central, or even necessary. Consider two toy examples. One policymaker facing a drought must decide whether to invest in a rain dance to increase the chance of rain. Another seeing clouds must decide whether to take an umbrella to work to avoid getting wet on the way home. Both decisions could benefit from an empirical study of rain. But each has differ-ent requirements of the estimator. One requires causality: Do rain dances cause rain? The other does not, needing only prediction: Is the chance of rain high enough to merit an umbrella? We often focus on rain dance–like policy problems. But there are also many umbrella-like policy problems. Not only are these prediction prob-lems neglected, machine learning can help us solve them more effectively. In this paper, we (i) provide a simple frame-work that clarifies the distinction between causation and prediction; (ii) explain how machine learning adds value over traditional regression approaches in solving prediction problems; (iii) provide an empirical example from health policy to illustrate how improved predictions can generate large social impact; (iv) illustrate how " umbrella " problems are common and important in many important pol-icy domains; and (v) argue that solving these problems produces not just policy impact but also theoretical and economic insights. 1 I. Prediction and Causation Let Y be an outcome variable (such as rain) which depends in an unknown way on a set of variables X 0 and X . A policymaker must decide on X 0 (e.g., an umbrella or rain dance) in order to maximize a (known) payoff function $\pi$(X 0 , Y) . Our decision of X 0 depends on the derivative d$\pi$(X 0 , Y)},

Studies employing macro data report consistently larger estimates than micro studies: 0.6 vs. 0.1 on average. The difference remains 0.5 when we control for 30 factors that reflect the context in which researchers obtain their estimates, such as data frequency, geographical coverage, variable definition, estimation approach, and publication characteristics. We also find that evidence for habits strengthens when researchers use lower data frequencies, employ log-linear approximation of the Euler equation, and utilize open-economy DSGE models. Moreover, estimates of habits differ systematically across countries.},

@article{Stampini2012,
abstract = {Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) are an endogenous innovation from Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) that aims to reduce current poverty while developing the human capital of the next generation, in the attempt to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Pioneered in Brazil and Mexico in the late 1990s, by 2011 CCTs had spread to 18 countries in the region and covered as many as 129 million beneficiaries. In this paper, we use administrative and household survey data to document (i) the evolution of CCTs and poverty in LAC, (ii) the relationship between expanded coverage and the quality of targeting and (iii) the change in beneficiary household characteristics. We show that in most countries the transfers represent over 20{\%} of poor beneficiaries' incomes, and the poverty headcount index would be on average 13{\%} higher, had CCTs not been implemented. A decade of sustained and widespread economic growth has expanded the fiscal space for social assistance. The largest programs (in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico) have achieved coverage rates around 50-55{\%} of the poor. At the same time, economic growth contributed to reducing the incidence of poverty. As a result, the number of CCT beneficiaries overtook the number of poor in the region in 2006 (using a standardized income poverty line of USD 2.5 per day (purchasing-power-parity adjusted)). Higher coverage was accompanied by increasing levels of leakage. For example, the share of non-poor beneficiaries increased from 46{\%} to 65{\%} in Ecuador over the period 2004-10, and from 40{\%} to 61{\%} in Mexico over the period 2002-10. Beneficiaries' level of education and participation in formal labor markets have increased. Yet, the analysis of household data shows that CCT beneficiaries remain mostly poor or vulnerable, characterized by extremely low levels of schooling and unstable labor market outcomes. Hence, while further expansion of the programs may in many cases be unnecessary, the need for social assistance and human capital development remains high. The transition to the new generation of CCT programs will require focusing on the quality of the services that accompany the transfers, in order to maximize the impact on current and future poverty},

We also compared the relative effectiveness of UCTs delivered in-hand with in-kind transfers, conditional cash transfers, and UCTs paid through other mechanisms., Search methods, We searched 17 academic databases, including the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE, and EMBASE between May and July 2014 for any records published up until 4 May 2014. We also searched grey literature databases, organisational websites, reference lists of included records, and academic journals, as well as seeking expert advice., Selection criteria, We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as cohort, interrupted time series, and controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs) on UCTs in LMICs. Primary outcomes were the use of health services and health outcomes., Data collection and analysis, Two authors independently screened all potentially relevant records for inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed the included studies' risk of bias. We requested missing information from the study authors., Main results, Three studies (one cluster-RCT and two CBAs) comprising a total of 13,885 participants (9640 children and 4245 adults) as well as 1200 households in two LMICs (Nicaragua and Niger) met the inclusion criteria. They examined five UCTs between USD 145 and USD 250 (or more, depending on household characteristics) that were provided by governmental, non-governmental or research organisations during experiments or pilot programmes in response to droughts. Two studies examined the effectiveness of UCTs, and one study examined the relative effectiveness of in-hand UCTs compared with in-kind transfers and UCTs paid via mobile phone. Due to the methodologic limitations of the retrieved records, which carried a high risk of bias and very serious indirectness, we considered the body of evidence to be of very low overall quality and thus very uncertain across all outcomes., Authors' conclusions, Additional high-quality evidence (especially RCTs of humanitarian disaster contexts other than droughts) is required to reach clear conclusions regarding the effectiveness and relative effectiveness of UCTs for improving health services use and health outcomes in humanitarian disasters in LMICs.},

abstract = {El programa de Asignaciones Familiares – Plan de Equidad (AFAM-PE) ha sido implementado en Uruguay desde el año 2008 y consiste en una transferencia monetaria otorgada a los hogares con menores de 18 años en condiciones de vulnerabilidad socioeconómica. El objetivo de este trabajo consiste en analizar el impacto del programa AFAM-PE sobre la probabilidad de contribuir a la seguridad social por parte de las personas adultas pertenecientes a hogares beneficiarios. Para ello, se utilizará un diseño de Regresión Discontinua (RD) que aprovecha la existencia de una regla clara para definir la participación en el programa y se utiliza como fuente de información a la “Encuesta de Condiciones de Vida” realizada en el marco del convenio MIDES- UDELAR para la evaluación de impacto del programa. En ella se recoge información tanto de individuos elegibles para participar al programa como de individuos no elegibles de características similares. Se encuentra que el programa AFAM-PE no tiene efectos significativos sobre la tasa de ocupación, el empleo y las horas trabajadas. Sin embargo, se observa un impacto significativo y negativo sobre la probabilidad de contribuir a la seguridad social principalmente en los atributarios. Además, estos efectos presentan mayor intensidad en jóvenes, mujeres e integrantes de hogares nucleares. Los principales resultados de este trabajo no difieren de los hallados para programas similares implementados en América Latina.},

abstract = {This article analyzes the impact of PANES, a temporary social assistance program carried out in Uruguay between 2005 and 2007, on school attendance and child labour for children aged 14 to 17. We explore three potential explanatory channels: labour market outcomes, household income and awareness of conditionalities. Our research is based on a panel of PANES applicants. The data includes the administrative records of the program and two waves of a follow-up survey. Program effects are identified using regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference estimations. We were not able to identify any effect on school attendance or child labour for children aged 14 to 17 as a whole or by specific sub-groups. At the same time, we did not find any impact on household income or adult labour, which suggests that income substitution is not explaining the lack of results in terms of schooling. Neither could we identify differences in behavioral responses depending on the awareness of conditionalities. It therefore appears that either the design of the transfer scheme was not suitable to promote behavioral changes (lump sum per household; monthly payments to adults; conditionalities not enforced) or the determinants of school attendance for this age group are more complex and require complementary interventions.},

Average effect sizes for all outcomes in primary and secondary schooling are statistically different from zero. Average effect sizes for secondary enrollment, attendance and dropout are larger than those for primary. For all outcomes and schooling levels, there is considerable heterogeneity in effect sizes. Programs with more generous transfers have larger primary and secondary enrollment effects. Programs that condition benefit receipt on achievement and pay transfers less frequently than monthly, exhibit larger enrollment and attendance effects. Effect sizes are no different in programs with random assignment. We find evidence in support of publication bias and selective reporting.},

I present a direct non-laboratory test of this implication using data on the nutritional intake of food stamp recipients. Caloric intake declines by 10 to 15 percent over the food stamp month, implying a significant preference for immediate consumption. These findings constitute a rejection of the permanent income hypothesis and are extremely difficult to reconcile with exponential discounting. The data support an explanation based on time preference and reject several alternative explanations, including highly elastic intertemporal substitution. I explore implications for the optimal timing of transfer payments under alternative assumptions about preferences. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Drawing on a database of more than one hundred anti-poverty interventions in 47 countries, Targeting of Transfers in Developing Countries provides a general review of experiences with methods used to target interventions in transition and developing countries. Written for policymakers and program managers in developing countries, in donor agencies, and in NGOs who have responsibility for designing interventions that reach the poor, it conveys what targeting options are available, what results can be expected as well as information that will assist in choosing among them and in their implementation. Key messages are: While targeting “works” - the median program transfers 25 percent more to the poor than would a universal allocation - targeting performance around the world is highly variable. Means testing, geographic targeting, and self-selection based on a work requirement are the most robustly progressive methods. Proxy means testing, community-based selection of individuals and demographic targeting to children show good results on average, but with considerable variation. Demographic targeting to the elderly, community bidding, and self-selection based on consumption show limited potential for good targeting. There is no single preferred method for all types of programs or all country contexts. Successful targeting depends critically on how a method is implemented.},

This report provides results from a randomised control trial that was designed to better understand how to improve targeting in Indonesia. Specifically, during the expansion of Indonesia's real conditional cash transfer programme , Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH), we randomised three different targeting methodologies — proxy means testing, self - targeting and community targeting – across 600 villages. We found that, when poverty is defined by consumption, self - targeting identifies poorer beneficiaries than proxy means testing and it has lower administrative cost s . Community targeting is less effective than proxy means testing in ide ntifying the poor based on per capita consumption, but it results in higher satisfaction levels with the programme.},

Finally, it discusses possible alternatives to extend social-protection systems while maintaining incentives for formal work in Latin America's labour markets.},

Comparable results for the three countries indicate that the effects that the programs have had on the labor supply of participating adults have been mostly negative but are nonetheless small and not statistically significant. However, the evidence does point to the pres- ence of other effects on labor markets. In the case of PROGRESA, there is a small labor income.Moreover, PROGRESA seems to have reduced female labor-force par- ticipation in ineligible households. These results imply that large-scale interventions may have broader equilibrium effects.},

However the potential for mistargeting of program funds is high. This article focuses on the social consequences arising from misallocation of resources in close-knit communities. We find that the mistargeting of a cash transfer program in Indonesia had significant negative social consequences. The prevalence of crime within communities increased and participation in community groups declined. Hence poorly administered transfer programs have a potentially large negative downside that extends beyond the pure financial costs that have been the focus of the literature to date.},

abstract = {There is limited empirical evidence on whether unrestricted cash social assistance to poor pregnant women improves children's birth outcomes. Using program administrative micro-data matched to longitudinal vital statistics on the universe of births in Uruguay, we estimate that participation in a generous cash transfer program led to a sizeable 15{\%} reduction in the incidence of low birthweight. Improvements in mother nutrition and a fall in labor supply, out-of-wedlock births and mother's smoking all appear to contribute to the effect. We conclude that, by improving child health, unrestricted unconditional cash transfers may help break the cycle of intergenerational poverty.},

This paper estimates the impact of a large anti-poverty cash transfer program , the Uruguayan PANES , on political support for the gov-ernment that implemented it. Using the discontinuity in program assignment based on a pretreatment eligibility score , we find that beneficiary households are 11 to 13 percentage points more likely to favor the current government relative to the previous govern-ment. Political support effects persist after the program ends. Our results are consistent with theories of rational but poorly informed voters who use policy to infer politicians ' redistributive preferences or competence , as well as with behavioral economics explanations grounded in reciprocity.

abstract = {Are the large enrollment effects of conditional cash transfer programs a result of the conditions or simply the cash? Tis paper presents the first experimental evidence on the effectiveness of conditionality in cash transfer programs for schooling. Using data from an intervention in Malawi that featured randomized conditional and unconditional treatment arms, the authors find that the program reduced the dropout rate by more than 40 percent and substantially increased regular school attendance among the target population of adolescent girls. However, they do not detect a higher impact in the conditional treatment group. Tis finding contrasts with previous non-experimental studies of conditional cash transfer programs, which found negligible “income” effects and strong “price” effects on schooling. Te authors argue that their findings are consistent with the very low level of incomes and the high prevalence of teen marriage in the region. Te results indicate that relatively small, unconditional cash transfers can be cost-effective in boosting school enrollment among adolescent girls in similar settings.},

For such a purpose we use an evaluation sample that includes a number of villages where the program was not implemented for evaluation purposes. We estimate a structural model of education choices and argue that without such a framework it is impossible to evaluate the effect of the program and, especially, possible changes to its structure. We also argue that the randomized component of the data allows us to identify a more flexible model that is better suited to evaluate the program. We find that the program has a positive effect on the enrollment of children, especially after primary school. We also find that an approximately revenue neutral change in the program that would increase the grant for secondary school children while eliminating for the primary school children would have a substantially larger effect on enrollment of the latter, while having minor effects on the former.},

The main identification strategy is based on measurement error in the assignment to treatment variable that produced a randomized treatment sample. The incentives led to significant improvements in test taking rates, conditional pass rates, and mean test scores. Improvements were mediated through changes in teaching methods, enhanced after-school teaching, and increased responsiveness to students' needs.

annote = {Objective: Measure the effect of individual monetary incentives on English and math teachers in Israel (mainly on their pedagogy, effort, productivity in terms of student's achievments, and teacher grading ethics). More generally, measure the effects of pay-for-performance incentives in a given setting.
Results/Conclusion: Program that gave monetary incentives to teachers led to improvements in test taking rates, conditional pass rates, and mean test scores. Improvements were mediated through changes in teaching methods, enhanced after-school teaching, and increased responsiveness to students' needs. No evidence was found of manipulation of test scores by teachers.
Theory: No model
Empirical strategy: They exploit a natural experiemtn due to random measurement error in the assignment variable. Explanation: schools were assigned to a program treatment if matriculation rate in 1999 was lower than 45{\%}. Now, meausre of matriculation used was innacurate and revised figures were avilable later. So author argues that conditional on true matriculation rate, program status of the school may be virtually randomly assigned due to mistakes in the preliminary files and thus comparing treated and un-treated school,, conditional on true matriculaion rate, lets us measure the causal impact of the treatment. More in particular, in a subsample of 98 schools, they find 18 were “erroneously“ treated. They create a matching procedure where they include all untreated schools that are within +-1 percent of the true matriculation rate of any of the 18 errounesly treated schools; final sample es 36 schools.
Data: They don't list the specific sources of information but they designed the evaluation so collected some data and also got some other data from the Ministry of Education or maybe from the educational institutions directly (sources are not clear)
